# Pinocchio
JavaFX application that lets the user read Pinocchio in English and Italian simultaneously to assist in learning the language.

This is a personal project created to solidify my knowledge in Java and JavaFX. I chose this book because I like to learn Italian in my free time and "Le avventure di Pinocchio: Storia di un burattino" or "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi is public domain and can be found for free online.

## Features

- Side by side display of both Italian and English text
- Saves your reading progress on the current page and chapter when the program exits using serialization
- Text in each language starts and ends in the same place in the story on each page despite translation differences
