# Pinocchio
JavaFX application that lets the user read Pinocchio in English and Italian simultaneously to assist in learning the language.

- This is a personal project created to solidify my knowledge in Java and JavaFX.
- I chose to focus on one book for this project, although it could be expanded to multiple books and languages in the future.
- This particular language and book was chosen because I like to learn Italian in my free time and "Le avventure di Pinocchio: Storia di un burattino" or "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi is public domain and can be found for free online.
